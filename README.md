# Food-Recipe-App
The technologies used to create a food recipe app using ReactJS include:

ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building the user interface. It provides reusable components to structure the app.

JavaScript (ES6+): The primary programming language for the app, utilizing modern ES6+ features such as arrow functions, modules, and destructuring.

HTML & JSX: JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript used to define React components that render HTML elements.

CSS: Used to style the app and give it a responsive and visually appealing layout.

Node.js & npm: Node.js and npm are used for managing packages and running the React development environment (e.g., via create-react-app).

React Hooks: Built-in hooks like useState for managing the component state (e.g., handling selected recipes, search functionality).

Optional API (future enhancement): Can be added to fetch real-time recipe data from a backend or third-party service.
